[quote=About this mod]This mod was quite a quite simple idea, but yet something fun to play with :) It was suggested about half a year ago, so I delayed it until next easter :p
Nothing too fancy in there, the goat have white skin, a bunny mask (from Payday) and an inventory. Then eggs are randomly generated on the map, and the goat stats are updated regularly depending on the number of eggs you hold ^^
